logic.js uses d3 to fetch earthquake data from USGS. It then creates a map and instates a layer over that map using the fetched data.

It places points at the latitude and longitude of the earth quake data that was fetched. It creates bubbles at those points in which the size represents the magnitude and the color represents the depth.

It also adds a popup that includes information about each earthquake when the user mouses over them in the map.

Finally it adds a legend.

The map can be viewed and interacted with by opening the index.html
